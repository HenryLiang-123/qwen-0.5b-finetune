Unfortunately, there is no specific record provided that lists his graduation date. However, based on the education details given, we can infer that his undergraduate studies were completed at UCLA, which would place him in the academic year ending in 2023.\n\nSince he started working in 2024, and assuming he has been employed since then, we can calculate the start date of his education. Given that he was a Data Scientist II starting in 2024, if we assume he had a Master\u2019s degree before becoming a Data Scientist, this might be around 2023.\n\nTherefore, we can estimate that Henry Liang began his education at UCLA in 2023, with a Master's degree likely being part of his program.",
